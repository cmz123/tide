TiDE is a Visual Studio Code extension that makes developing TiDB a breeze.

Still in the loop of coding, compiling, copying binary to servers, restarting every process and pulling information from logs everywhere?

**Try and see how TiDE makes TiDB development experience great again!**

## Quick start

1. Install the extension

   - Install from [Visual Studio Code MarketPlace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dragonly.ticode), or
